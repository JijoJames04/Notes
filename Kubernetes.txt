* Configuration management
---------------------------
You can maintain all the changes in the infrastructure with the
help of software
    - Immutability


Installation
-------------
1. Kubectl
2. Minikube (already installed with Docker Desktop)
3. Kubeadm
4. Bert option: Cloud provider

kubectl version --output=yaml   // to check the version

minikube start      // to start a cluster
(download everything needed to run a kubernetes cluster)

minikube status     // to check the status of the cluster created by minikube

kubectl get pods    // to see the pods running

kubectl get nodes   // to see the nodes running

minikube dashboard  // to see the in-built dashboard (on localhost)

minikube docker-env     // to see the environment variables that are required to communicate
                        // your local computer with remote servers

docker container ls     // to see the containers required by kubernetes


Everything that is running inside a virtual machine is running inside a container.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


minikube ssh    // to go inside minikube
                //(inside minikube it installed docker runtime)
        |
        docker ps   // to see all the containers that are running inside minikube

kubectl config view     // this is the config file
                        // It has the information about our cluster

kubectl config current-context  --> minikube
                        // to see the current context

kubectl get all         //to see the pods that are running, services, deployments and services


Deployment is a type of controller.
------------------------------------


kubectl delete pod podName      // to delete a specific pod

kubectl get deployments         // to see the deployments

kubectl delete deployments deploymentName   // to delete a specific deployment

kubectl get pods                // to see the pods that are also deleting
(Because the deployment is deleted, so the pods of the deployment are also gone)

kubeconfig file contains information that will be relevant to access your cluster.
