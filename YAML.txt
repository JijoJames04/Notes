YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language
----------------------------------
- Data format used to exchange data 
- Similar to XML and JSON
- In YAML, you can store only data, and not commands


Data Serialisation
-------------------
Process of converting data objects into a complex data structure
- These objects are passed in streams into storage

Object -> Stream -> Storage -> Stream -> Object


Data Deserialisation
---------------------
Reverse process of data serialisation
ie, Converting complex data structures into data objects


                        stream          |------> YAML / File 
Object -> Serialiser --------------------------> Database
                        of bytes        |------> Memory

Object = Code + Data

Serialisation is the process of converting this object (code + data) 
into series of bytes that saves the state of this object in a form
that is easily transmittable

Data Serialisation Languages : YAML, JSON, XML
(Used to represent data in code)

Uses:
- Configuration files --> Docker / Kubernetes, etc
- Logs, Caches, etc

Benefits:
----------
* Simple and easy to read
* It has a strict syntax - Indentation is important
* Easily convertable to JSON, XML
* Most languages use YAML
* More powerful when representing complex data
* Parsers, etc various tools available
* Parsing is easy (Parsing is reading the data)


Key --> Value

YAML is case-sensitive
